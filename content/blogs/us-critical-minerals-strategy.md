## The Profit Problem in the U.S. Critical Minerals Race

The United States is not falling behind in the global competition for critical minerals due to a scarcity of resources, but because of a lack of a profitable financial model. Despite bipartisan consensus on the strategic need for these materials, current policies have failed to foster an economically sustainable industry.

Without a clear path to profitability, both public and private investments risk becoming financial dead-ends. To secure its mineral supply chains, the U.S. must create a financial framework that attracts long-term capital.

## Understanding the Economic Dynamics

A functional critical minerals supply chain consists of three stages: mining, midstream processing, and final manufacturing. China currently leads all three—not due to superior resources, but because of strategic economic planning. State-backed subsidies protect Chinese firms from losses, enabling long-term dominance.

The U.S., on the other hand, expects each sector—mining, refining, and production—to be individually profitable. This fragmented approach increases risk and discourages investment. In small, opaque, and volatile markets dominated by Chinese spot pricing, Western companies struggle to compete when China drives prices down deliberately.

## A Market-Led Strategy to Compete with China

America’s capital markets are the most sophisticated globally. Rather than defaulting to centralized planning, the U.S. should treat private capital as a strategic advantage. A successful market-based model should focus on four strategic pillars:

### 1. Build Vertically Integrated Supply Chains

Government-backed but privately managed investment funds should be created to support full supply chains for specific minerals like gallium or antimony. Incentives should be performance-based, issued only upon completing an end-to-end supply chain, ensuring quasi-vertical integration and early-stage offtake agreements.

### 2. Regain Pricing Power

To break China’s pricing influence, the U.S. must establish a floor for domestic mineral prices. Strategies include targeted tariffs on subsidized imports and stricter domestic sourcing rules for clean energy and defense applications. These measures help stabilize revenue projections for investors.

### 3. Reduce Investment Risk

Key deterrents to investment are price volatility and demand uncertainty. Risk can be mitigated through long-term offtake agreements and public-private mechanisms like stockpiles or trading houses that establish price floors for sensitive materials.

### 4. Ensure Long-Term Policy Stability

Investor confidence hinges on predictable regulations and incentives. Critical mineral development spans decades, requiring sustained support through tax credits, grants, and loans—not as temporary tools but as permanent features of the investment environment.

## Building a Competitive Market Alternative

China’s success lies not just in access to resources but in its ability to shape the market. The U.S. must counter this by building a resilient financial system driven by market principles and innovation. Identifying new reserves and opening mines is important, but without a long-term financial strategy, dependency on China will persist.

Critical minerals should no longer be viewed solely as a resource issue—they represent a critical economic challenge. Solving it requires a market design that encourages capital flow, supports profitability, and secures U.S. leadership in the
