    category: "Mining",
    date: "February 22, 2025",
    content: `As the world accelerates its shift toward renewable energy, the demand for critical minerals — particularly Nickel, Cobalt, and Copper — has surged. These minerals are vital in manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and other green technologies.

      Africa, and Zambia specifically, holds vast untapped reserves of these strategic resources. Seneca Zambia plays a pivotal role by providing sourcing and logistics solutions that connect these resources to global markets. Our operations emphasize ethical extraction, local empowerment, and sustainability.

      Through partnerships with global firms and investments in community-focused projects, Seneca ensures that mineral wealth leads to long-term regional development. In doing so, Africa transforms from a raw materials supplier into a vital stakeholder in the global clean energy value chain.`
